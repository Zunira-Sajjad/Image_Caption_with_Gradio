# Image_Caption_with_Gradio
This repository contains a web application built with Gradio and the BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) model for automatic image captioning. It allows users to upload an image and generates a descriptive caption using a pre-trained image-captioning model from the Hugging Face Transformers library.
